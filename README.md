# Cydney's Portfolio

Cydney's Portfolio is a digital portfolio made with React, React Router DOM, Bulma, and Bootstrap. This portfolio includes my recent projects, where to contact me, my skill set, etc. Feel free to [view my portfolio of all my current and past projects](https://cydneypo034.github.io/cyddesport/#/)

## Updates
- Formatted application to be Single Page instead of multiple.
- Removed all navigation links except Contacts
- Removed emailjs, replaced it with HeroTofu
- Redid the portfolio section by creating cards out of the projects. This was done so the user could read the projects and access the websites. The overlays have been removed  since the portfolio information only appears when the user taps the image.
